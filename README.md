## **Basic Throws** 
These are the two main types of throws which all other advanced techniques are based on. 
### Backhand 
The disc is held in front of the player. When throwing, the disc moves across the body from left to right and is released when the arm is fully extended. The flight path starts straight or to the right, and finishes to the ***left***. Like throwing a normal frisbee.

### Forehand 
Also known as side arm, the disc is held out to the side of the player. When throwing, the disc moves forward in front of the player and is released when the wrist snaps forward and the arm is extended. The flight path starts straight or to the left, and finishes to the ***right***. Like throwing a baseball.

## **Advanced Throws**
These techniques are used to maximize distance or follow a particular flight path, depending on the disc's characteristics. The following descriptions assume the player is using a backhand throw. For a forehand throw, the flight path finishes to the right where a backhand throw would be to the left. 
### Hyzer Flip
- Disc stability: Understable
- Disc release angle: Hyzer

Once thrown, the disc's unstability flips it up flat or slightly anhyzer and holds a straight flight path. The flight path finishes ***straight*** or to the ***left*** depending on the disc's fade value.
### Flex Shot
- Disc stability: Overstable
- Disc release angle: Anhyzer

Once thrown, the disc's overstability turns it flat and holds an S-shaped flight path. The flight path finishes ***straight*** or to the ***left*** depending on the disc's fade value. 
### S Shot
- Disc stability: Understable
- Disc release angle: Flat

Once thrown, the disc's understability turns the flight path to the right. The flight path finishes to the ***left***.
### Anhyzer Shot
- Disc stability: Any stability
- Disc release angle: Anhyzer

Once thrown, the initial anhyzer angle forces the disc to immediately start a flight path to the right. The flight path finishes to the ***right*** and may result in a skip. Depending on the disc's stability, the amount of anhyzer that is needed on release will change. 
### Turnover
- Disc stability: Understable
- Disc release angle: Flat to slightly hyzer

Thrown more to the left, the disc's understability naturally turns the flight path to the right. The flight path finishes to the ***right***. Unlike an Anhyzer shot, the disc always lands flat and has little movement on the ground.

## **Utility Throws**
These techniques are used for getting around obstacles or when a normal, unobstructed flight path is not possible. For consistent results, these are usually thrown with overstable drivers. 
### Spike Hyzer
Like a normal backhand throw, except the hyzer angle is extreme - anywhere from 45 degrees to completely vertical. The disc is thrown more upwards and is meant to get over trees or tall bushes. The flight path finishes slightly to the ***left***.

### Grenade
Identical to the Spike Hyzer, but the disc is held upside down. The flight path finishes ***straight***.

### Tomahawk
Like a normal forehand throw, except released overhead. The disc is thrown forward up to about 45 degrees and is meant to fit through small gaps. The flight path finishes slightly to the ***left***.

### Thumber
Identical to the Tomahawk, but the disc is facing outward ("upside down"). Unlike a normal forehand grip, the thumb is placed on the inside rim and the side of the index finger pinches the disc tight. The flight path finishes slightly to the ***right***.
