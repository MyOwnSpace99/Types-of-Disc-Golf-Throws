## Basic Throws 
These are the two main types of throws which all other advanced techniques are based on. 
### Backhand 
The disc is held in front of the player. When throwing, the disc moves across the body from left to right and is released when the arm is fully extended. The flight path starts straight or to the right, and will finish to the left.
### Forehand 
Also known as side arm, the disc is held to the side of the player. When throwing, the disc moves forward in front of the player and is released when the arm is fully extended. The flight path starts straight or to the left, and will finish to the right.
  
## Advanced Throws
These techniques are used to maximize distance or follow a particular flight path, depending on the disc's characteristics. The following descriptions assume the player is using a backhand throw. For a forehand throw, the flight path finish will be to the right where a backhand throw would be to the left. 
### Hyzer Flip
- Disc stability: Understable
- Disc release angle: Hyzer

Once thrown, the disc's unstability will flip it up flat or slightly anhyzer and holds a straight flight path. The flight path will finish straight or to the left depending on the disc's fade value.
### Flex Shot
- Disc stability: Overstable
- Disc release angle: Anhyzer

Once thrown, the disc's overstability will turn it flat and holds an S-shaped flight path. The flight path will finish straight or to the left depending on the disc's fade value. 
### S Shot
- Disc stability: Understable
- Disc release angle: Flat

Once thrown, the disc's understability turns the flight path to the right. The flight path will finish to the left.
### Anhyzer Shot
- Disc stability: Any stability
- Disc release angle: Anhyzer

Once thrown, the initial anhyzer angle forces the disc to immediately start a flight path to the right. The flight path will finish to the right and may result in a skip. Depending on the disc's stability, the amount of anhyzer that is needed on release will change. 
### Turnover
- Disc stability: Understable
- Disc release angle: Flat to slightly hyzer

Thrown more to the left, the disc's understability will naturally turn the flight path to the right. The flight path will finish to the right. Unlike an Anhyzer shot, the disc always lands flat and has little movement on the ground.

## Utility Throws
These techniques are used for getting around obstacles or when a normal, unobstructed flight path is not possible. For consistent results, these are usually thrown with overstable drivers.
